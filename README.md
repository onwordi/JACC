## Overview
Users want to be able to see a history of their shopping lists and remember what they ordered, quantity with an estimate of price.

With this app, we will create an MVP, using just one user Jane Doe, to show how easy it is to add/view to their shopping list.

## :ok_woman: User journey
1. User goes to the website and sees a **Welcome User page**

2. User clicks on ` Add to list ` button

3. User see the **Shopping List page**
  <br>a) User will see a **form** with the following fields: Item, Quantity, Approx Price, to add their data
  <br>b) User will submit form
  
4. User will be taken to **Current list page** to view the whole list
  <br>a) There will be a button ` Add more items ` to add more items
  
5. User will be taken back to Shopping list page to add more
